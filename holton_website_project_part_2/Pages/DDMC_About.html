				<h2> History Of The Club </h2> 
					<p>
						The Devils Disciples Motorcycle Club is an MC founded in 1973 by Vince Hudson originating in New York City. In the early 2000s the club fell on tough times due to a run-in with law enforcement, the organization crumbled when some of the founding members were imprisoned and some killed. In early 2018 the club was re-established by Vinceâ€™s son Kevin Hudson, who opened a charter in Vespucci, Los Santos where the club currently resides. The Devils Disciples are a 1% MC through and through and intend to stay true to that at all costs.

				<h2> What is a 1% Motorcycle club?</h2> 
					<p> 
						The American Motorcycle Association is to have coined the moniker 1%er In 1947 the  AMA held a Motorcycle rally that was plagued by violence and hooliganism. As a result of this the AMA said "99 percent of the Motorcycle riding public are law abiding; there is 1 percent who are not." The 1% patch was then created and became a Motorcycle subculture indicating those who wore the 1% patch were known for "Outlaw Ways"
